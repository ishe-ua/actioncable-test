# Simple chat

The simplest chat is an application on Rails5, PostgreSQL, which
allows to send messages between two users. Implement it using
Web-sockets. One of important requirements is persistence of
conversation, so when a user starts a conversation, we need to store
user's message in the database. You can keep front-end part simple to
save your time.
